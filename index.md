## Welcome to All about Redis Internals

This is a web site to introduce design or implementation inside Redis. Not sure how deep it is.

In couple of weeks ago, I read an article occasionally which title is like "The best engineering interview question I've ever met". The title attracted me a lot and I started to read the article. The main idea of the article is that the author was asked to modify `memcached` to add a new capability "multiply by" to a key.

It inspired me to [Start a discovery journey for Redis internals](./start.md)

Will try to analyze Redis internals from source code level. All articles in this space will be related to Redis.
